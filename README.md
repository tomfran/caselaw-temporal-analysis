# Legal Texts Retrieval

The goal of the project is to apply information retrieval techniques to legal text, in particular, LDA topic modelling and Word Embeddings. 

The main idea is to study words in a temporal axis, finding trends regarding context or single or group of words, trends in frequency and regarding topics. 

A complete overview of the methodology and the results can be found on the [project report](https://github.com/tomfran/legal-texts-information-retrieval/blob/main/report/report.pdf).

The project is accessible through a [webapp](https://illinois-cases-analysis-webapp-qka7d4ktba-ew.a.run.app/), please mind the loading time required if an instance is not running, about 1 to 3 minutes.
