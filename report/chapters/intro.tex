\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to study words among the 
temporal axis in court decisions. 
More precisely, we aim to find information about relevance and 
frequency of single or multiple terms, and also to discover
correlations between them. 
The dataset in use is the Illinois portion of the Harvard Caselaw Access Project.

The work is accessible at Github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tomfran/caselaw-temporal-analysis}} and can be
tested by using the developed webapp\footnote{\url{https://illinois-cases-analysis-webapp-qka7d4ktba-ew.a.run.app/}}.
